Home Assistant Laifen Custom Integration 

This is a work in progress project, intended to integrate Laifen wave toothbrush to Home assistant.

This version will provide the following sensors:
- Status Sensor
- Mode sensor
- Vibration Strength
- Oscillation Speed
- Oscillation Range

I welcome any help improving BLE communication
